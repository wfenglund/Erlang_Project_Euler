# erlang_project_euler
A repository for me to track my solutions for the first 100 Project Euler problems.

To test a solution:
```bash
$ erlc pe_001.erl
$ erl -noshell -s pe_001 start -s init stop
```

Note: this repository exists for me to track my own solutions and for others if they are interested in how one could solve these problems using the programming language erlang. If you have not solved these problems yourself, dont spoil your fun by looking at my proposed solutions. Instead, make an account at https://projecteuler.net/ and solve it on your own.
